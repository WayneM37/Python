Simple dictionary which used local data file

"""This is simple dictionary. When you enter an English word it returns the Turkish \
    translation. If the entered word is not in our dictionary, it asks to enter\
        the Turkish translation. Dict. data is stored in dict_2.json file. 
     """
     Not: You just need to create "dict_2.json" file in your working directory.
